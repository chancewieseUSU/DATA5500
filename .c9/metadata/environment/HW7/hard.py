"],"id":67},{"start":{"row":1,"column":0},"end":{"row":10,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":["Deleting a node from a binary search tree involves a few steps. Depending on the structure of the tree and node, it may vary how the node is deleted. Because it is a binary search tree, each node has two children at most. Additionally, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node. Generally, deleting a node from a binary search tree can be broken down into three different cases: Deleting a node with no children, one child, or two children.","Deleting Nodes:","Deleting a node with no children is the easiest case. If the node has no children, it can be removed from the tree by updating the parent’s reference to ‘None.’ This will remove it and its values from the tree. ","Deleting a node with one child is a little more complicated. When deleting a node with one child, we have to ensure that the child of the node is linked correctly to it (the parent). We can replace the node to be deleted with its child. For example, if we need to delete a node that is a left child, and it has a left child itself, then we move that left child up to be in place of the node we want to delete. Then eventually we can delete the node we wanted to.","Deleting a node with 2 children becomes more complex, but works very similarly to the last case. We need to find either the smallest node in the right subtree (inorder successor) or largest node in the left subtree (inorder predecessor). We then replace the node to be deleted, with either the inorder successor or predecessor.","Edge Cases:","One edge case is deleting the root node. When you delete the root note, you have to reassign the root of the tree after you delete it. You may have to update the root to its left or right child","Another edge case is deleting a non-existent node. This isn’t much of a problem, but we have to prepare for when a deletion request is made and that node doesn’t exist. We need to ignore the request or spit out an error message.","One last challenge is maintaining the binary search tree property. When you delete a node, it’s crucial to ensure that the resulting tree still stays a binary search tree, so you have to be careful with values and variables. You have to make sure you are correctly linking parent nodes to their children and maintaining order. If you are reassigning nodes or adding them out of order, it can mess up the entire tree.
